# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

## Project Introduction
This project demonstrates a practical cybersecurity risk assessment for a fictional organization. The goal is to identify critical assets, analyze potential threats and vulnerabilities, and evaluate risks that could impact confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Scope and Assets
- User accounts and credentials
- Internal network systems
- Customer data (PII)
- Business-critical applications

## Risk Analysis
The assessment focuses on:
- Identifying threats such as phishing, malware, and unauthorized access
- Evaluating vulnerabilities including weak passwords and misconfigured systems
- Assessing likelihood and potential impact of each risk

## Risk Evaluation
Risks are categorized as low, medium, or high based on:
- Asset value
- Threat likelihood
- Potential business impact

## Mitigation Recommendations
- Implement strong identity and access management controls
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Conduct regular security awareness training
- Perform routine security audits and vulnerability assessments

## Conclusion and Next Steps
This assessment highlights the importance of proactive risk management. Future work could include automating risk scoring, integrating real vulnerability scan data, and aligning controls with frameworks such as NIST CSF.
